    <p class="text-gray-800 text-xl leading-loose mb-6">This project is a desktop application. By the way, it's
      developed with a focus on front-end development, using the web UI for the GUI and other languages for specific
      jobs, like Python for deep learning, Java for web HTTP, and Rust for some CLI tools. The function split with GUI
      is becoming more popular. So, using Tauri is a trial to develop the desktop app.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 text-xl leading-loose">Tauri is a cross-platform framework for desktop applications. In
      this project, we chose Vue for the front end and Rust for the back end to run the spider work. The multi-language
      approach is a fun way to do things. At the time, I started learning Rust, so everything is correct.</p>
